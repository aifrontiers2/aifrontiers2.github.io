This same challanges manifests itself in all AI enabled systems. For example, users do not know what skills/apps exists that can handle their requests and they also do not know how to interact with those skills/apps in a natural way. Additionally, these systems have limited ability for contextual conversational understanding. We discuss these issues and explain what is needed to truly understand the user’s intent and serve the most relevant answer for the user’s request.</span></div></div><div class="bio"><span class="title">Speaker Bio</span><span class="content">Ruhi Sarikaya joined Amazon Alexa team as the Director of Applied Science in 2016.

This same challanges manifests itself in all AI enabled systems. For example, users do not know what skills/apps exists that can handle their requests and they also do not know how to interact with those skills/apps in a natural way. Additionally, these systems have limited ability for contextual conversational understanding. We discuss these issues and explain what is needed to truly understand the user’s intent and serve the most relevant answer for the user’s request.</div></div></div><div class="speech"><div class="speech"><div class="speech-title"><span class="speaker-name">Dilek Hakkani-Tur</span>&nbsp;:&nbsp;Conversational machines: Deep Learning for Goal-Oriented Dialogue Systems</div><div class="speech-description">Creating automated agents with human-level intelligence still remains one of the most challenging problems of AI.

These can be independently built and jointly optimized for dialogue quality and efficient task completion using supervised or reinforcement learning methods. The talk will summarize novel aspects of each component, and highlight novel approaches where we view dialogue as a collaborative game between a user and an agent: The user has a goal in mind and the agent has access to the data that user is interested in, and can perform actions in order to realize the user’s goal. The two engage in a conversation so that the agent can learn the user requirements and help the user browse possible alternatives and find a way for task completion. </div></div></div></div></div><div class="session"><div class="left"><div class="time">11:30 - 12:30pm</div><div class="session-title">Robots</div><div class="speakers"><div class="speaker"><img class="photo" src="/images/speakers/dileep-01.jpg"><span class="name">Dileep George</span><span class="position">Co-Founder</span><span class="company">Vicarious</span></div><div class="speaker"><img class="photo" src="/images/speakers/kaijen.jpg"><span class="name">Kaijen Hsiao</span><span class="position">CTO</span><span class="company">Mayfield Robotics</span></div></div><div class="moderator"><div class="title">moderator:</div><div class="speaker"><img class="photo" src="/images/speakers/xuezhao_lan.jpg"><span class="name">Xuezhao Lan</span><span class="position">Founding Partner</span><span class="company">Basis Set Ventures</span></div></div></div><div class="right"><div class="session-title">Robots</div><div class="session-description">A panel of industry experts from companies that are actively developing robots come together to discuss their work.

He will share how his team have overcome these challenges.</div></div></div></div></div><div class="session dim"><div class="left"><div class="time">10:30-11:00am</div></div><div class="right"><div class="session-title">Break</div></div></div><div class="session"><div class="left"><div class="time">11:00-11:30pm</div><div class="session-title">Training Machines to Design Fashion</div><div class="speakers"><div class="speaker"><img class="photo" src="/images/speakers/Ambarish_Kenghe.png"><span class="name">Ambarish Kenghe</span><span class="position">Chief Product Officer</span><span class="company">Myntra</span></div></div></div><div class="right"><div class="session-title">Training Machines to Design Fashion</div><div class="session-description">Fashion is partly an Art and that makes it difficult to understand and create through machines. Myntra is using modern AI techniques to crack this problem and is now able to design many fashion article through machines with no designer intervention whatsoever. This is more than an experiment; we are selling these on our platform with great success. Myntra's Chief Product Office will talk about how they have achieved this and what is next. This can have broad applicability for design in other fields as well. He will also touch on AI techniques Myntra is leveraging to create significant impact of other parts of their business.</div><div class="speech"></div></div></div><div class="session"><div class="left"><div class="time">11:30-12:00pm</div><div class="session-title">Morning Talks Session 2</div><div class="speakers"><div class="speaker"><img class="photo" src="/images/speakers/andy_pandharikar.png"><span class="name">Andy Pandharikar</span><span class="position">CEO and Co-founder</span><span class="company">Commerce.AI</span></div></div></div><div class="right"><div class="session-title">Morning Talks Session 2</div><div class="session-description">Presentations and Demos from exciting <b>AI startups</b>.<br>Morning Talks: Leading startup founders or CTOs to speak on their products. <br></div><div class="speech"><div class="speech"><div class="speech-title"><span class="speaker-name">Andy Pandharikar</span>&nbsp;:&nbsp;Deep Product Learning</div><div class="speech-description">There are over 5 billion unique products sold worldwide with over 30K new products introduced every month. We are using deep learning to understand product data and associated consumer feedback in the form of natural language. We call it “Deep Product Learning ®”. When AI starts to understand which product features work well, and which don’t, it can start influencing product design as well as marketing and merchandising. But it all starts with building reliable product matching and categorization systems. I will describe why these are non-trivial challenges and highlight other fundamental problems in this space that deep learning can finally solve. I will share our learning from building an applied AI startup and end the talk with our vision for the AI to disrupt commerce as the industry.</div></div></div></div></div><div class="session"><div class="left"><div class="time">12:00-12:30pm</div><div class="session-title">Deep Learning and the Digital Transformation</div><div class="speakers"><div class="speaker"><img class="photo" src="/images/speakers/Zico_Kolter.jpg"><span class="name">Zico Kolter</span><span class="position">Chief Data Scientist</span><span class="company">C3 IoT</span></div></div></div><div class="right"><div class="session-title">Deep Learning and the Digital Transformation</div><div class="session-description">We are in the midst of a digital transformation: a shift in virtually every industry based upon ubiquitous sensing (IoT), hugely scalable computing, vast amounts of data, and artificial intelligence.  At C3 IoT, we have developed a platform to enable and accelerate this digital transformation, used by our customers across multiple industry sectors.  This talk will focus on the role of deep learning within this platform, which provides the "algorithmic glue" to unlock value in enterprise digital transformations.  Using the C3 IoT Platform, data scientists can rapidly develop and deploy scalable deep learning services that run against all relevant enterprise data and capture business value in production settings.  I will specifically focus on the role of deep learning in "non-traditional" settings (that is, domains that don't involve images, speech, or language).  I will highlight C3 IoT's work using deep learning to both detect fraud and predict and forecast failures.  Across the board, deep learning enables better performance with substantially less human engineering than traditional methods, and offers the potential for truly universal analysis of data.</div><div class="speech"></div></div></div><div class="session dim"><div class="left"><div class="time">12:30-1:30pm</div></div><div class="right"><div class="session-title">Lunch</div></div></div><div class="session"><div class="left"><div class="time">1:30-3:00pm</div><div class="session-title">Afternoon Talks</div><div class="speakers"><div class="speaker"><img class="photo" src="/images/speakers/roland_memisevic.jpg"><span class="name">Roland Memisevic</span><span class="position">Chief Scientist and <br>Co-Founder</span><span class="company">TwentyBN</span></div><div class="speaker"><img class="photo" src="/images/speakers/ashutosh_garg.jpg"><span class="name">Ashutosh Garg</span><span class="position">CEO and Founder</span><span class="company">Volkscience</span></div></div></div><div class="right"><div class="session-title">Afternoon Talks</div><div class="session-description">Presentations and Demos from exciting <b>AI startups</b>.<br> Afternoon Talks: Leading startup founders or CTOs to speak on their products. <br></div><div class="speech"><div class="speech"><div class="speech-title"><span class="speaker-name">Roland Memisevic</span>&nbsp;:&nbsp;Common sense video understanding at TwentyBN</div><div class="speech-description">Deep learning has evolved not linearly but through a series of step-functions: sudden unexpected outbreaks of capability, which fundamentally changed the envelope of what computers are able to do.  At TwentyBN, we have created spatio-temporal video models and data infrastructure that allowed us to grow approximately one million labeled videos showing everyday common-sense scenes and situations - many of them extremely subtle.  This allowed us to successfully train neural networks end-to-end on a wide range of action understanding tasks, that neither hand-engineering nor neural networks had appeared anywhere near solving just a few months ago.  I will show how these recognition tasks now drive commercial value at TwentyBN, and how they drive our long-term AI agenda for learning common sense world knowledge through video.</div></div></div><div class="speech"><div class="speech"><div class="speech-title"><span class="speaker-name">Ashutosh Garg</span>&nbsp;:&nbsp;AI will take jobs away or will bring the right job to people</div><div class="speech-description">50% of unemployment in US is because qualified people are not getting matched to right jobs. Many diversity candidates get filtered out because of inherent bias in our interview process. While most people are worried about AI taking over their job, AI can help people get the job they deserve. People's career trajectory is a fascinating time series data. Will show you how one can use AI on top of this data to predict what people will do next in their career.
