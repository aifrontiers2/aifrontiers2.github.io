It’s time when plans are being made for our AI Frontiers Conference in Santa Clara, California. November 3-5, over 1500 researchers, experts and leaders will be joining us at the Santa Clara Convention Center. AI Frontiers Conference brings together leaders in cutting-edge AI research and development to share with you the success of current large-scale implementation and upcoming products.

Over 100 volunteers are needed to make sure our conference runs smoothly and efficiently. We very welcome you to join us, help us set-up, organize and coordinate the event. 
We are confident you will be blessed by what you experience!
 
Our conference volunteers will receive a complimentary t-shirt, free lunch, free ticket to the talk, great social and learning opportunities in premier AI community. Plus PARTY!!!
