We cordially invite your company to be a sponsor at our AI Frontiers Conference [http://aifrontiers.com](http://aifrontiers.com) on November 3-5, 2017 in Santa Clara, CA. This conference features speakers in deep learning and applied AI from from leading companies to share the latest advances in deep learning products. We have sessions on chatbots, natural language processing, robots, autonomous driving, games, video understanding and so on.

Our attendees are data scientists, data engineers, technical managers and AI startup entrepreneurs. Some of them are in career transition or look for new opportunities. This conference will be an excellent opportunity for your company to reach the large community of deep learning practitioners. It’s also a platform for brand building and recruiting. We look forward to work with your company in this event.

Our sponsors, depending on support level, have opportunities to set up booths, host lunch table discussion and advertise their jobs. Our goal is creating an environment where sponsors can interact with all attendees and attract the targeted audience. By making our conference the best applied AI conference, we attract the best people to attend. Our conference announcement goes out to close to 1 million people through our media partners, where our sponsor logos will be viewed many times. During the conference, all our attendees will visit the exhibitor’s booths as they are arranged next to the food area.

We appreciate your participation and look forward to seeing you at Santa Clara Convention Center in November.

Sincerely,
