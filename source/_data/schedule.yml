                title: "Natural Language Interaction Challenges for Intelligent Personal Assistants"
                description: "There are three fundamental challenges in interacting with the applications and services running behind intelligent personal assistants (IPAs): 1) application/service discovery, 2) learning what these applications can do, and 3) limited information flow into the apps/services. This same challanges manifests itself in all AI enabled systems. For example, users do not know what skills/apps exists that can handle their requests and they also do not know how to interact with those skills/apps in a natural way. Additionally, these systems have limited ability for contextual conversational understanding. We discuss these issues and explain what is needed to truly understand the user’s intent and serve the most relevant answer for the user’s request."

                description: "Progress in artificial intelligence is starting to give robots the ability to perceive their environment. While deep learning has created classification systems that exceed human abilities in certain domains, manipulation tasks require a richer understanding of the world than classification or detection. To this end, Vicarious focuses on building systems with greater data efficiency, flexibility of reasoning, and transfer of knowledge between tasks. Combining task relevant features from deep learning with active perception, handling of uncertainty, and closed loop planning can mitigate many of the commonly encountered errors in robot manipulation. I'll describe our progress, the opportunities we are exploring, and the problems that remain to be solved."

Kuri uses embedded, deep-learning-based algorithms for face, pet, and person detection, as well as for place recognition (for mapping and localization).  Such algorithms are crucial for enabling her endearing interactions with people, as well as her ability to be the family videographer and entertainer. Cute behaviors also enable Kuri to subtly and smoothly gather necessary data for training and inference, providing a significant benefit in improving core functionality for adorable home robots."

                description: "Video is becoming ubiquitous on the web. From the capture and creation to consumption a lot of amazing things are happening. As folks working in AI this poses a new challenge and great opportunity for us. If we can make machines understand video the way humans do then we can unlock a long set of applications. But, to be able to get there we need to solve many challenging problems, some of which are obvious ones that the academic community is solving – Datasets, Action Recognition, Multi-Modal understanding, Temporal aggregation, Modeling appearance and motion, Compression etc. I would like to discuss these direction and also talk about more longer term directions on self-serve content understanding, large label embedding and video summarization and so on."

But for each problem, getting a deep model to work well involves research into the architecture and a long period of tuning. We present a single model that yields good results spanning multiple domains. This single model is trained concurrently on ImageNet, multiple translation tasks, image captioning, a speech recognition corpus, and an English parsing task. We achieved state-of-the-art performance while training much quicker and generating long coherent pieces, even on the scale of full Wikipedia articles. Our new architectures improve the ability to generate both text and images."

                description: "Most AI assistants on mobile phones uses a conversational user interface (CUI) that mimics a chat app and translates user requests to API calls to backend services. I will present Conversational GUI (CGUI) which provides a thin layer of conversational interaction on top of existing GUI of mobile apps, by translating user requests into sequences of GUI actions such as clicks and swipes that user would have to perform by themselves. CUI avoids rebuilding existing user experiences in a chat window. More importantly, it makes it possible for end users, instead of software engineers, to create new skills by providing pairs of natural language expressions and a demonstration of the GUI actions."

                description: "Deep learning has evolved not linearly but through a series of step-functions: sudden unexpected outbreaks of capability, which fundamentally changed the envelope of what computers are able to do.  At TwentyBN, we have created spatio-temporal video models and data infrastructure that allowed us to grow approximately one million labeled videos showing everyday common-sense scenes and situations - many of them extremely subtle.  This allowed us to successfully train neural networks end-to-end on a wide range of action understanding tasks, that neither hand-engineering nor neural networks had appeared anywhere near solving just a few months ago.  I will show how these recognition tasks now drive commercial value at TwentyBN, and how they drive our long-term AI agenda for learning common sense world knowledge through video."

Many diversity candidates get filtered out because of inherent bias in our interview process. While most people are worried about AI taking over their job, AI can help people get the job they deserve. People's career trajectory is a fascinating time series data. Will show you how one can use AI on top of this data to predict what people will do next in their career. This can then be used by enterprises to optimize their hiring process."
