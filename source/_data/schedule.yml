                title: "Natural Language Interaction Challenges for Intelligent Personal Assistants"
                description: "There are three fundamental challenges in interacting with the applications and services running behind intelligent personal assistants (IPAs): 1) application/service discovery, 2) learning what these applications can do, and 3) limited information flow into the apps/services. This same challanges manifests itself in all AI enabled systems. For example, users do not know what skills/apps exists that can handle their requests and they also do not know how to interact with those skills/apps in a natural way. Additionally, these systems have limited ability for contextual conversational understanding. We discuss these issues and explain what is needed to truly understand the user’s intent and serve the most relevant answer for the user’s request."

                description: "Creating automated agents with human-level intelligence still remains one of the most challenging problems of AI. In this talk, I will present recent developments in Google Research for end-to-end goal-oriented dialogue systems, with components for language understanding, dialogue state tracking, policy, and language generation. These can be independently built and jointly optimized for dialogue quality and efficient task completion using supervised or reinforcement learning methods. The talk will summarize novel aspects of each component, and highlight novel approaches where we view dialogue as a collaborative game between a user and an agent: The user has a goal in mind and the agent has access to the data that user is interested in, and can perform actions in order to realize the user’s goal. The two engage in a conversation so that the agent can learn the user requirements and help the user browse possible alternatives and find a way for task completion. "

                title: "Opportunities and challenges for robot manipulation"
                description: "Progress in artificial intelligence is starting to give robots the ability to perceive their environment. While deep learning has created classification systems that exceed human abilities in certain domains, manipulation tasks require a richer understanding of the world than classification or detection. To this end, Vicarious focuses on building systems with greater data efficiency, flexibility of reasoning, and transfer of knowledge between tasks. Combining task relevant features from deep learning with active perception, handling of uncertainty, and closed loop planning can mitigate many of the commonly encountered errors in robot manipulation. I'll describe our progress, the opportunities we are exploring, and the problems that remain to be solved."

        description: "We are in the midst of a digital transformation: a shift in virtually every industry based upon ubiquitous sensing (IoT), hugely scalable computing, vast amounts of data, and artificial intelligence.  At C3 IoT, we have developed a platform to enable and accelerate this digital transformation, used by our customers across multiple industry sectors.  This talk will focus on the role of deep learning within this platform, which provides the \"algorithmic glue\" to unlock value in enterprise digital transformations.  Using the C3 IoT Platform, data scientists can rapidly develop and deploy scalable deep learning services that run against all relevant enterprise data and capture business value in production settings.  I will specifically focus on the role of deep learning in \"non-traditional\" settings (that is, domains that don't involve images, speech, or language).  I will highlight C3 IoT's work using deep learning to both detect fraud and predict and forecast failures.  Across the board, deep learning enables better performance with substantially less human engineering than traditional methods, and offers the potential for truly universal analysis of data."

                description: "Deep learning has evolved not linearly but through a series of step-functions: sudden unexpected outbreaks of capability, which fundamentally changed the envelope of what computers are able to do.  At TwentyBN, we have created spatio-temporal video models and data infrastructure that allowed us to grow approximately one million labeled videos showing everyday common-sense scenes and situations - many of them extremely subtle.  This allowed us to successfully train neural networks end-to-end on a wide range of action understanding tasks, that neither hand-engineering nor neural networks had appeared anywhere near solving just a few months ago.  I will show how these recognition tasks now drive commercial value at TwentyBN, and how they drive our long-term AI agenda for learning common sense world knowledge through video."
